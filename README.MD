# ngx-form-object

Ng-form-object is an abstration on top of Angular's FormBuilder.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install ngx-form-object --save
```

##### app.module.ts
```js
...
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import { NgxFormObjectModule } from 'ngx-form-object';
...

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    ...
  ],
  imports: [
    ...
    NgxFormObjectModule
    ...
  ],
  providers: [
    ...
  ],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }

```

## Usage

### 1. Creating a model

The model will be used to populate the form. The model must implement `FormModel` interface.

The model must specify which properties are attribute properties (his own properties).

The model must specify which properties are belongsTo properties.

The model must specify which properties are hasMany properties.

i.e.
```js
import { FormModel } from 'ngx-form-object';

class User implements FormModel {
<!-- TODO describe how to specify attribute, hasMany, and belongsTo properties -->
}
```

### 2. Create a base form object
Base form object is just an abstraction on top of our other form objects. All other form object will extend base form object. Base form object is optional but it is highly recommended as it simplifies the code by giving us the ability to specify data which can be accessed from all other form objects.

i.e.
```js
import { FormObject, FormModel, FormObjectOptions } from 'ngx-form-object';

export class BaseFormObject extends FormObject {
  constructor(
    public model: FormModel,
    protected options: FormObjectOptions
  ) {
    super(model, options);
  }
}

```

### 3. Create a specific form object class
The task of a specific form object is to manage forms of a specific type.
<!-- TODO list all the properties of a form object -->

```js
import { BaseFormObject } from 'app/forms/base-form-object/base.form-object';

export class UserFormObject extends BaseFormObject {

}
```

In case base form object doesn't exist, `UserFormObject` can directly extends `FormObject`.


### 4. Create a form store (form)
Form store is created based on belonging form object. Form object is created out of the model.

i.e.
```js
const user: User = new User();
const userFormObject: UserFormObject = new UserFormObject(user, null);
const userForm: FormStore = this.formObjectBuilder.create(userFormObject);
```

<!-- TODO list form object parameters -->

### 5. Map form store to the template
As ngx-form-store is an abstraction on top of reactive forms, `ReactiveFormsModule` must be imported.
Form store can be used in a template in the same way as any other form created by Angular's `FormBuilder`.

i.e.
```html
<form [formGroup]="userForm">
  <input formControlName="name" />
</form>
```

### 6. Create a service for our model
To save the form (the model), we can simply call `.save()` on `FormStore` instance.
i.e.
```
userForm.save();
```

This will search for a service responsible for handling with user model. Form object will search for the service in formObject.serviceMappings[key]. `serviceMappings` is an object and can be defined inside base form object, or inside each of form object.

i.e.
#### base.form-object.ts
```js
...
constructor(
  private
) {
  this.serviceMappings = {
    user: injector.get(UserService),
  };
}
```

In this case, `injector` is used for injecting the service.
Key in the serviceMappings object represents the model type _______ TODO
Value in the serviceMappings object represents an instances of a service.

## Development

To generate all `*.js`, `*.d.ts` and `*.metadata.json` files:

```bash
$ npm run build
```

To lint all `*.ts` files:

```bash
$ npm run lint
```

## TODO

  - [ ] Implement Attribute, HasMany, and BelongsTo decorators which define model properties
  - [ ] Improve FormModel interface (some of the properties are required)
  - [ ] Handle errors when form saving fails
  - [ ] Setup testing process
  - [ ] Add more tests
